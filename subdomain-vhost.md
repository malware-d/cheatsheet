# What is Virtual Host?

Virtual hosts are different websites on the same machine (refers to the practice of running more than one website (such as company1.example.com and company2.example.com) on a single machine. 
). In some instances, they can appear to look like sub-domains, but don‚Äôt be deceived! 

Virtual Hosting occurs when a domain is hosting other domain names on a single server or multiple other servers. This allows companies to share resources on a single server.

There are mainly 2 types of Virtual hosts:

1. **IP-based Virtual Host:** we have different IP addresses for every website.
2. **Name-based Virtual Host:** several websites are hosted on the same IP. Mostly this type is widely and preferred in order to preserve IP space.

*But when talking about `VHOST` we are generally talking about **Named-based Virtual hosts**.*
# [How does Gobuster brute force sub-domains in Vhost mode inside a private network like Hack The Box?](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackthebox/comments/nn6soh/how_does_gobuster_brute_force_subdomains_in_vhost/)

The answer is ***`Host header`***
![Vhost bruteforcing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90831245/204877681-08780eef-1d25-4128-8173-ff60a4191e2e.png)

Gobuster asking apache "do you host *ABC.domain.com*?" Has nothing to do with resolving *ABC.domain.com* to an IP address.

Gobuster requests the *ABC.server.com* by providing the **`Host:`** header. That's how gobuster enumerate sub-domains, even if the entry for sub-domains are not located in our */etc/hosts* file.

This is also how the webserver will differentiate to which website it has to send my requests since many websites are being hosted on the same server with the same IP.

It's through the "Host header". The web server identifies which content to serve up once it receives the Host header from the client.

üí¢üí¢üí¢That's why when using the **[wfuzz](https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz)** tool, you will have to provide the flag `-H "Host: FUZZ.domain.com"`üí¢üí¢üí¢

# [WFUZZ]((https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz))
WFUZZ is a web application bruteforcer. Combined with a wordlist, it can be used to scan domain names for files, directories or sub-domain.

*If you make a request to a web server to load a sub-domain, a lot of web servers are configured to return a default web page, even if the sub domain being requested does not exist.*

This is important to know because if we are trying to find a sub-domain, we need to find a way to exclude the `default responses` to find the sub-domain we are actually interested in.

To do this, run the command without any filters initially
```console
wfuzz -H "Host: FUZZ.target-domain-name.com" -w directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 10.129.187.245
```
There will probably be a lot of 200 response codes (or you will see the value of L (Line), W (Word), C (Character) identical, it is the parameter reflecting the default page).

 This is because, whilst these sub-domains don‚Äôt exist on the web server, the web server is still returning the default server web page. However, now that we know the **word/line/character** count of the default web page, we can exclude these from our results using the filters.

 *default page look like:*

## Filter Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                                                  |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -hc       | Hide responses with specified response code                                  |
| -hl       | Hide responses where count of lines on response is equal to specified value  |
| -hw       | Hide responses where word count of web page is equal to specified value      |
| -hh       | Hide responses where character count of web page is equal to specified value |

According to the above display results, we will eliminate the response with W = 1036.

```console
wfuzz -H "Host: FUZZ.thetoppers.htb" --hw 1036 -w subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -t 50 10.129.187.245
```

Result: s3.thetopper.htb

# gobuster
Gobuster is a brute-force scanner tool to enumerate directories, files, hidden dir, hidden files of websites, sub-domain and virtual host names. Gobuster is written in the Go programming language. 

The gobuster's mechanism is a trial-and-error method of finding an answer to a solution. This innately means Gobuster is a ‚Äúloud‚Äù enumerator that can be more easily detected by an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Gobuster will not recursively enumerate directories, so it‚Äôs a good idea to run Gobuster again on any discovered directories.

It has **three main modes** it can be used with:
* **dir:** the classic directory brute-forcing mode
* **dns:** DNS subdomain brute-forcing mode
* **vhost:** virtual host brute-forcing mode (not the same as DNS!)

## `dns` mode

`gobuster` tries to *DNS resolve* the subdomains it tries so it can verify if they exist or not. As there are cases in pentesting where a specific DNS server is required to be used, Gobuster gives us the possibility to do so using the `-r` flag.

* -d:  target domain
* -i: print the ip beside the subdomain that was found.
```console
gobuster dns -d thetoppers.htb -w subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -t 50 10.129.187.245 -i
[+]
[+]
[+]
=========================================
Found: s3.thetoppers.htb [10.129.187.246]
=========================================
```
## `vhost` mode

This mode should not be mistaken to be the same as the DNS mode. In the DNS mode the tool attempts to DNS resolve the subdomains. In vhosts mode the tool is checking if the subdomain exists by visiting the formed url and verifying the IP address.

* -u: target URL

```console
gobuster vhost -u thetoppers.htb -w subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -t 50 10.129.187.245
```
